description=[b]Polaroid Camera[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] 'Take Photo' option, which will take two screenshots, one with UI enabled, one with it hidden. It will then attempt to open the screenshot folder, or otherwise copy the path to the clipboard. You can upload these somewhere to later print a polaroid out of them.
description=    [*] 'Print Polaroid' option, which requires you to enter an image URL to create a Polaroid print. It doesn't matter where you've uploaded the picture, though it's good to use a direct link for best results.
description=    [*] Polaroid Cameras can be found in Electronics Shops, Camera Stores and Electronic Shelves of Gigamart

description=[b]Polaroid[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] 'View Photo' option, which opens the image either in the Steam Overlay, a web browser, or copies the URL to the clipboard if neither of the two were available
description=    [*] Ability to rename Polaroids, similar to Bags

description=[b]Photo Album[/b]
description=[list]
description=    [*] This is essentially just a small container item to hold Polaroids. It doesn't do anything special.
description=    [*] Photo Albums can be found in Living Room shelves
description=	[*] Photo Albums can also be crafted using a Book and some Duct Tape (just like in real life!)

description=[list]
description=    [*] Unfortunately it seems Project Zomboid is unable to open folders or web URLs directly in the explorer or web browser currently (at least on my Windows 10 system). Therefore it will attempt to open images in the Steam Overlay instead, or copy the URL to the clipboard if nothing worked.
